# Minesweeper

Inspired by [The Minesweeper game in 100 lines of JavaScript](http://slicker.me/javascript/mine/minesweeper.htm)

I decided to make my own version. Partly to see how easy it is.
Partly because there were some things lacking in that version that I 
wanted to fix.

My version comes in at around 300 lines of JavaScript, but I feel that it's cleaner 
and it does have a couple of features that the original is missing such as: 
* Shift left-click will reveal surrounding blocks.
* Removing the old grid when starting again.
* icon fonts instead of images.
 
Of course it may mean that my version is over engineered, 
but I'll leave that decision as an exercise for the reader.
